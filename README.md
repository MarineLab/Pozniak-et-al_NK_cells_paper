# Cytotoxic NK cells impede response to checkpoint immunotherapy in melanoma with an immune-excluded phenotype

This repository contains scripts used to analyse scRNAseq and spatial transcriptomic data.

## List of scripts / steps of the analysis

1. Preprocessing of all samples including DoubletFinder (GC_ALL.R) can be found here: https://github.com/MarineLab/Pozniak-et-al
2. Inference of copy number variations (CNV; HB_GC_ALL.R) can be found here: https://github.com/MarineLab/Pozniak-et-al
3. Analysis of the immune compartment only (xxxxx.R)

7. Example of Molecular Cartography (Resolve Biosciences) data analysis on one sample (Resolve_example.ipynb)

## Location of the raw data

The human data was deposited to the EGA portal with the study number: EGAS00001006488
The mouse data was deposited to the GEO portal with the study number: GSE207592

### Location of the rds files of the entire tumor micoenvironment and the immune cells
